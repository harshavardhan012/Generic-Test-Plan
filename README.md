## 2. Emulation vs. Real Silicon Differences

| Aspect                      | Details                                            |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Emulation Limitations       | Performance, cycle accuracy, missing components    |
| Real Silicon Only Features  | Features only testable in silicon                  |
| Workarounds                 | Workarounds used in emulation                      |
