## 2. Emulation vs. Real Silicon Differences

| Aspect                      | Details                                            |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Emulation Limitations       | Performance, cycle accuracy, missing components    |
| Real Silicon Only Features  | Features only testable in silicon                  |
| Workarounds                 | Workarounds used in emulation                      |

- Limitations in emulation (e.g., performance, cycle accuracy, missing components).
- Features only testable in silicon.

- List new features introduced in this silicon generation across different domains (Multimedia IP, PMM, IO, BIOS, OS boot, Security, etc.), but only populate relevant sections for each test item.
- Highlight modifications or improvements compared to previous versions.
- Any dependencies on firmware/model updates.
